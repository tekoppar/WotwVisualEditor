# WotwVisualEditor

A tool that allows you to customize colors and textures for the game Wotw

# Supported Versions
- Patch 2
- Patch 3
- Patch 3.1

# Installation
Download and extract the folder anywhere you'd like, run the application. There's nothing extra needed to do for different patches, the program will inject the correct dll depending on the patch version on it's own.

# How to use
Run the program and you'll have a window with several tabs where you can change textures & colors. Double click on a color to open a color picker to change the color you want. Once you have a setup you like set a "Setting Name" to what you want to name the it and then save the settings by clicking on the "Save Setting" and then click on "Apply Changes" to have the settings be applied in game.

You can then load saved settings from File -> Load Visual Settings

While you don't need to keep the program running after once you've applied your settings, without the program running it won't be able to reapply the settings in case the game recreates the uberPools for the modified objects. The best course is to minize the application once you've applied your changes. The program minimizes to the tray.
